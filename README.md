# web-scraper
A compact web-scraping tool for local machines written in Python with Selenium and Streamlit

# Disclaimer:

I did not come up with this project. I was asked by a friend to look into scraping data from a website with dynamicsally loaded content, and API based scraping didn't seem to be the way to go (as far as I could see with my very limited experience). So I followed various tutorials and cobbled together this little project, which in the end did what I set out to do.

But I want to make it very clear that I am not taking credit for this, as it is largely based on the work of other people, mainly Tim from [TechWithTim](https://www.techwithtim.net/) (this is his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo8-nEuDBkk&t=2082s) that is responsible for the main body of this project), and a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@writerbricks/scraping-dynamic-data-that-loads-on-scroll-with-python-c4c4970a54d1) by [Writer Bricks](https://medium.com/@writerbricks), which helped me with the dynamic scrolling part.
